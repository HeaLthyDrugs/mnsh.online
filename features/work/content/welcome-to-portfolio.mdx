## Inspiration

This portfolio is heavily inspired by the exceptional work of [Chánh Đại](https://chanhdai.com). I have adapted his beautiful UI and design principles to create this personal space, with additional influences from [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 & shadcn/ui
- **Language**: TypeScript

## Features

- **Design**: Clean, modern aesthetics with sharp edges.
- **Theming**: Seamless Light & Dark mode support.
- **Optimization**: Full SEO setup (JSON-LD, sitemap), PWA support, and fast performance.
- **Developer Experience**: Component registry and AI-friendly `/llms.txt`.

## Roadmap

I am continuously refining the experience. planned enhancements include:

- **Immersive Audio**: meaningful sound effects for interactions (hover, tap, toggle).
- **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile responses to create a more physical digital connection.

## Blog

- MDX & Markdown support
- Access markdown by adding `.md` to URLs, e.g. `/blog/welcome.md`
- Syntax Highlighting for better readability
- RSS Feed for easy content distribution
- Dynamic OG Images for rich previews

## Component Registry

Easily build and distribute your own components, hooks, and pages using a custom registry powered by the [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli).

Each component is well-documented through the Blog, featuring:

- **Live Preview**: Interactive component demos
- **Code Snippets**: Readable and copyable examples
- **Beautiful Code Blocks**: Styled for clarity and dark mode
- **Command Blocks**: One-click copy for quick install commands (`pnpm`, `npm`, `yarn`, `bun`)
