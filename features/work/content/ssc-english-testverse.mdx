## Overview

SSC English Testverse is an Android application developed for SSC aspirants to practice the English section through structured mock tests and topic-wise preparation.

The primary goal was to build a distraction-free testing environment with structured analytics and scalable content management.

---

## The Requirement

The client wanted:

- A dedicated English-focused test platform  
- Real exam-like mock simulations  
- Topic-wise test structure  
- Detailed performance analysis  
- No ads or promotional clutter  

The app needed to feel calm, focused, and serious — aligned with exam preparation.

---

## Solution Approach

The application was built with a modular architecture separating:

- Test engine logic  
- Content management  
- User progress tracking  
- Notification workflows  

Content is managed dynamically using a CMS, allowing the client to add and manage question sets without app updates.
